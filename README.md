# Shopping-App-for-Mobile-using-ReactNative
In this project, I have worked on a Shopping Mobile App where products are stored in realtime firebase database with firebase authentication using all core fundamentals of React Native Mobile App Development.

#How to see a demo of this project:

1- Install Expo-Client App in your android/ios mobile device from Playstore/Appstore.

2- Go to https://expo.io/@adityakshettri/the-location-app in your desktop and scan the QR code from your Expo-client App in your android/ios mobile device.

OR

2- Go to https://expo.io/--/to-exp/exp%3A%2F%2Fexp.host%2F%40adityakshettri%2Fthe-location-app in the browser from your android/ios mobile device.

OR

2- Go to @adityakshettri/the-location-app directly inside the Expo Client app in your android/ios mobile device.

3- This will automatically run my app in the Expo Client app in your android/ios mobile device. Now you can save various images with location in your app.

4- Also, my app will be automatically updated in your android/ios mobile device whenever it is required.
